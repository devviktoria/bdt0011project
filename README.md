# BDT-0011 Project

This is a shooting game project where the player has to kill aliens with a turret. This game is created with [Unity](https://unity.com/). It uses the Universal Render Pipeline now.

The [bdt0011](bdt0011) folder contains the Unity project.

The [graphicssource](graphicssource) folder contains the Blender and GIMP files, that were helpful when I created some assets for the game.
