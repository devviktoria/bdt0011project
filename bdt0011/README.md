# BDT-0011 Unity Project

This folder contains the actual Unity project for the game.

Please note that the bdt0011/Assets/FromStore directory has to be created manually, because this folder is not included in the GitHub repositiory. This folder contains free assets from the [Unity asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) that I use to create the game.

The documentation for that folder can be found [here](/documentation/FromStoreFolderContents.md).
